## 🔬 What is NEDD?  
NEDD is a **UI + AI Agent** designed to help scientists plan their **next experiments** in a **data-driven** way.  

When experiments are run, the parameter space is often explored **non-uniformly**. This leads to:  
- ⚠️ **Skewed data distributions**  
- ⚠️ **Regions of ignorance** (parameters left unexplored)  
- ⚠️ **Poor ML model training** on biased datasets  

NEDD helps prevent this by **visualizing parameter space**, highlighting **gaps in exploration**, and guiding **next step suggestions** with ML + LLM support.  

---

## 📊 Features  
- **Load & explore data**: Import your experimental dataset easily.  
- **Visualize parameter space**: Interactive pairplots show skewness and regions of ignorance.  
- **ML-ready datasets**: Ensure balanced coverage for better predictive modeling.  
- **Active Learning loop**: Suggest new experiments that maximize knowledge gain.  
- **LLM assistant**: Query your data in natural language and get experiment guidance.  

---

## 🌟 Why does it matter?  
Machine learning models thrive on **diverse and representative data**.  
If experiments are clustered in one corner of the parameter space, the model can’t generalize well.  
NEDD ensures:  
- ✅ **Uniform coverage of experimental space**  
- ✅ **Reduced bias in datasets**  
- ✅ **Fewer experiments needed** for strong ML predictions  
- ✅ **Smarter, faster materials discovery**

## 🚀 Future Vision  
We imagine NEDD as a **LLM-assisted experiment planner**, where you can:  
- Drop in your dataset  
- Chat with the AI about trends and missing regions  
- Get **optimized experiment suggestions** powered by ML, not randomness  
- Minimize experimental effort while maximizing discovery potential

## 💡 Example Workflow  
1. Load your dataset.  
2. Visualize with a pairplot → spot skewness.  
3. Train ML → identify uncertain regions.  
4. Use NEDD’s Active Learning agent → propose next 4–5 most informative experiments.  
5. Iterate until your model converges.
