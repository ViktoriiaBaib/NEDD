# Next Experiment Data Driven (NEDD)
## LLM Hackathon for Materials and Chemistry 2025

Ensure data-driven choice of parameters during experiment planning to ensure uniform exploration of parameter space in efficient way.
When running experiments, parameter space if often tested non-uniformly which leads to skewed data distribution, regions of ignorance and hiders ML training on this data for data-driven suggestions.
UI + AI Agent for next step suggestion when running / planning experiments.
